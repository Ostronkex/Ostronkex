# Hello World
### My name is Erik. I'm based in Stockholm, Sweden. 
### I'm slightly autistic and what I lack in social skills I make up for in commitment and productivity. If you want to interact with me or my projects in any way, be direct and don't hesitate to ask/tell me what's on your mind, as long as you can back it up with something actually productive/beneficial, otherwise I will dismiss it. 
### I currently work a low-end job in IT Support which I'm planning on leaving as soon as possible, though lack of motivation and no real goal in life makes this easier said than done.


I'm currently learning Python, following the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Angela Yu.
